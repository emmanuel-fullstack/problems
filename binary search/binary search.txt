Binary Search

Binary Search is a searching algorithm that operates on a sorted or monotonic search space, repeatedly dividing it into halves to find a target value or optimal answer in logarithmic time O(log N).

Conditions to apply Binary Search Algorithm in a Data Structure
To apply Binary Search algorithm:

The data structure must be sorted.
Access to any element of the data structure should take constant time.

Binary Search Algorithm
Below is the step-by-step algorithm for Binary Search:

1.Divide the search space into two halves by finding the middle index "mid". 
2.Compare the middle element of the search space with the key. 
3.If the key is found at middle element, the process is terminated.
4.If the key is not found at middle element, choose which half will be used as the next search space.
-> If the key is smaller than the middle element, then the left side is used for next search.
-> If the key is larger than the middle element, then the right side is used for next search.
This process is continued until the key is found or the total search space is exhausted.

Implementation
---------------------
def binarySearch(arr, x):
    low = 0
    high = len(arr) - 1
    while low <= high:

        mid = low + (high - low) // 2

        # Check if x is present at mid
        if arr[mid] == x:
            return mid

        # If x is greater, ignore left half
        elif arr[mid] < x:
            low = mid + 1

        # If x is smaller, ignore right half
        else:
            high = mid - 1

    # If we reach here, then the element
    # was not present
    return -1

if __name__ == '__main__':
    arr = [2, 3, 4, 10, 40]
    x = 10

    result = binarySearch(arr, x)
    if result != -1:
        print("Element is present at index", result)
    else:
        print("Element is not present in array")
