Bubble Sort Algorithm Steps (Points Format)

You can directly paste this into your GitHub README 👇

1️⃣ Start from the first element of the array.
2️⃣ Compare the current element with the next element.
3️⃣ If the current element is greater than the next element:

Swap them.

4️⃣ Move to the next pair of adjacent elements.
5️⃣ Continue this process until the end of the array.

This completes one pass.

The largest element is now placed at the end.

6️⃣ Repeat the same process for the remaining unsorted portion.

After each pass, one element gets fixed at the end.

7️⃣ Stop when:

All elements are sorted
OR

No swaps occur in a pass (optimized version).
