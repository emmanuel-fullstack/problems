🟢 Selection Sort Algorithm (Step-by-Step Points)
🔹 What is Selection Sort?

Selection Sort works by:

Selecting the minimum element

Placing it at the beginning

Repeating for the remaining array

Unlike Bubble Sort, it does fewer swaps.

🟡 Selection Sort Algorithm Steps

You can paste this in your repo 👇

1️⃣ Start from index 0.
2️⃣ Assume the current index has the minimum element.
3️⃣ Compare this element with all remaining elements.
4️⃣ If a smaller element is found:

Update the minimum index.

5️⃣ After completing inner loop:

Swap the smallest element with the current index.

6️⃣ Move to next index and repeat.
7️⃣ Stop when array is fully sorted.

🔵 Example

Array:

[5, 1, 4, 2, 8]
Pass 1:

Minimum = 1
Swap with 5
→ [1, 5, 4, 2, 8]

Pass 2:

Minimum = 2
Swap with 5
→ [1, 2, 4, 5, 8]

Pass 3:

Minimum = 4
No change

Pass 4:

Minimum = 5
No change

Sorted ✅

def selection_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)

    for i in range(n):
        min_index = i

        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            if arr[j] < arr[min_index]:
                min_index = j

        arr[i], arr[min_index] = arr[min_index], arr[i]

    return arr
